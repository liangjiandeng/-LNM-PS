% Description: 
%           Visualize and print an eight-band multispectral image.
% 
% Interface:
%           showImage8(I_MS,print,id,flag_cut_bounds,dim_cut,th_values,L)
%
% Inputs:
%           I_MS:               Eight band multispectral image;
%           print:              Flag. If print == 1, print EPS image;
%           id:                 Identifier (name) of the printed EPS image;
%           flag_cut_bounds:    Cut the boundaries of the viewed Panchromatic image;
%           dim_cut:            Define the dimension of the boundary cut;
%           th_values:          Flag. If th_values == 1, apply an hard threshold to the dynamic range;
%           L:                  Radiomatric resolution of the input image.
